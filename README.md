# Doris MCP Server

Doris MCP Server is a backend service that exposes [Apache Doris](https://doris.apache.org/) through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). AI clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, and others) can query Doris data through a governed **semantic metrics layer** built on [MetricFlow](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow), with raw-SQL discovery as a fallback path. It ships with a Web UI for managing semantic models and a CLI client for scripting.

## Core Features

*   **Semantic Metrics Layer**: Define metrics once in YAML (simple / ratio / derived / cumulative / conversion), query them from any MCP client. MetricFlow compiles semantically correct SQL — no hand-written aggregation queries.
*   **Multi-Workspace Isolation**: Fully isolated tenants with their own models, compiler, and Doris storage tables. Models are stored in Doris itself (`active` + `staging` tables), so multiple server nodes share state without file sync.
*   **Staging Workflow**: All model changes go through *staging → validate → commit*; broken models can never affect running queries.
*   **Guided Tooling**: 10 MCP tools with an enforced workflow (`get_query_guide` → `check_service_health` → semantic query, or metadata discovery → raw SQL fallback).
*   **Credential Pass-Through**: `Authorization: Bearer <doris-user>:<password>` — every query runs under the caller's own Doris identity with per-user connection pools. No shared admin credentials.
*   **Web UI**: Login with Doris credentials to edit/validate/publish models, manage workspaces, and deploy the bundled example — no YAML tooling required.
*   **CLI Client**: `mcp-client` for calling tools and pushing/pulling model files from scripts and CI/CD.
*   **Multi-Node Ready**: Session affinity is handled in-app using the server IP recorded in the Web UI cookie; nginx stays a plain reverse proxy.
*   **Self-Contained Packaging**: Release tarballs bundle a Python 3.10 runtime and all dependencies. No network, no pip, no system Python required on target machines.

## System Requirements

*   **Server host**: Linux x86_64 or ARM64 (for running the release package)
*   **Database**: Apache Doris FE reachable via MySQL protocol (default `127.0.0.1:9030`)
*   **Building from source**: curl/wget, or a local Python 3.10.x for offline builds

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Get the package

Download the latest release from [Releases](../../releases):

```bash
tar xzf doris-mcp-server-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz
cd doris-mcp-server
```

Or build from source (see [Building from Source](#building-from-source)).

### 2. Start the server

The default points to a same-host Doris FE (`127.0.0.1:9030`). For a separate deployment, set `server.fe_host` to the FE private IP or hostname, then:

```bash
# Foreground
./start-mcp-server.sh

# Background
nohup ./start-mcp-server.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

The server listens on port **3000** by default.

### 3. Connect your MCP client

Authentication is your **Doris username and password** passed as a Bearer token:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <doris-user>:<doris-password>
```

**Claude Desktop / Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http doris http://<host>:3000/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <user>:<password>"
```

**Cursor / VS Code (`mcp.json`):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "doris": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://<host>:3000/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <user>:<password>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A ready-to-copy template is provided at [`mcp.json.example`](mcp.json.example).

**Smoke-test the connection with the FastMCP CLI:**

```bash
fastmcp call http://<host>:3000/mcp check_service_health \
  --auth "<user>:<password>" --json
```

### 4. Deploy the example workspace (Web UI)

1. Open `http://<host>:3000/mcp/web` and log in with your Doris credentials (management operations require the Doris `admin` user).
2. Click the **example deploy** button. Deployment runs in the background; the page polls progress and redirects when done.
3. Back in your AI client, ask: *"What is the total order amount by channel?"* — the agent will discover the `example` workspace and query metrics like `total_amount` grouped by `channel`.

### 5. Manage semantic models

**Web UI** (`/mcp/web`): create/upload/edit YAML models → **Validate** → **Commit**. Only validated models go live.

**CLI client:**

```bash
export DORIS_MCP_SERVER=http://<host>:3000
export DORIS_MCP_TOKEN=<user>:<password>

./mcp-client.sh semantic push ./models -w my_workspace
./mcp-client.sh semantic pull -o ./backup -w my_workspace
./mcp-client.sh tool call list_metrics --json '{"workspace":"my_workspace"}'
```

## How the Agent Queries Data

```
get_query_guide()              ← 1. workflow instructions (always first)
check_service_health()         ← 2. Doris connectivity + workspace status
    │
    ├─ semantic layer healthy ─→ list_metrics → list_dimensions_for_metric → query_metric
    │                             (counts, sums, ratios, rankings, trends)
    └─ no matching metric ─────→ list_databases → list_tables → describe_table → execute_query
                                  (raw SQL fallback, read-only validated)
```

## Configuration (`mcp-server.toml`)

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `server.mcp_host` / `server.mcp_port` | `0.0.0.0` / `3000` | HTTP listen address |
| `server.fe_host` / `server.fe_port` | `127.0.0.1` / `9030` | Doris FE endpoint; set a private IP or hostname for remote FE deployment |
| `query.db_whitelist` | `[]` | Optional database allow-list |
| `query.query_timeout_seconds` | `600` | SQL query timeout |
| `query.query_max_rows` | `10000` | Max rows per query |

All values support `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation.

## Multi-Node Deployment

Multiple server nodes behind one load balancer work without an affinity configuration. On the first successful Web UI login, a concrete `server.mcp_host` is written directly into the session cookie; when listening on `0.0.0.0`, the server instead reads the local IPv4 address on which the request arrived. The cookie format is `session_id.<server-ip>`. If a later request reaches another node, the middleware forwards it to the node recorded in the cookie. nginx needs no cookie parsing, and `/mcp` traffic stays node-local. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) §8.3 for details.

## Building from Source

```bash
./build.sh linux-x64      # Linux x86_64
./build.sh linux-arm64    # Linux ARM64
./build.sh macos-arm64    # macOS Apple Silicon
./build.sh clean          # remove build artifacts
```

The build downloads a standalone Python 3.10 and produces a self-contained tarball in `dist/`. If GitHub is unreachable, point to a local Python 3.10:

```bash
DORIS_MCP_SYSTEM_PYTHON=/opt/miniconda3/bin/python ./build.sh linux-x64
```

**CI releases** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): pushing a tag named `doris-mcp-server-x.y.z` builds linux-x64 + linux-arm64 packages and publishes a GitHub Release for that version. A release can also be triggered manually from the Actions page.

## Running Tests

```bash
bash test/run_all_tests.sh --offline   # unit tests, no server needed
bash test/run_all_tests.sh --smoke     # quick smoke test
bash test/run_all_tests.sh             # full suite (needs a local server)
```
